# Sheriff of Nottingham

## Set Up

### Each player takes:
- a Merchant Stand along with the matching Merchant Bag
- 50 Gold (20 x1, 5 x5, 1 x5)
- 6 goods cards (see below)

### Other
- remove 12 Royal Good if not playing with them
- shuffle cards and deal 6 to each player
- rest of cards face down
- discard 5 to each side
- players can examine these piles at anytime

### Three player game
- remove all cards that have the “4+” icon 
- Continue playing until all players have been the Sheriff three times.

## Playing

### Notes
- Each round one player is the Sheriff while the other players are the merchants
- The player who is acting as the Sheriff only participates in Phase 4, Inspection, and Phase 5, End of Round. 
- At the end of each round, players will pass the Sheriff Marker to the left allowing a new player to become Sherif
- The game continues until each player has been the Sheriff twice (three times in a three-player game).
- RUNNING OUT OF GOLD
  - If you cannot pay a Penalty you owe, you must give the player Legal Goods from your Merchant Stand with a value at least equal to the amount you owe
  - This may mean you give more value than you owe, but you won’t receive change for the excess.
  -  If you do not have enough Legal Goods, you must reveal and hand over Contraband to make up the difference. 
  - If you have exhausted all the Goods and contraband in your Market Stand to pay a debt, any leftover debt is considered paid. 

### Steps
1. Market
2. Load Merchant Bag
3. Declaration
4. Inspection
5. End of Round

#### Market
- Starting with the player to the Sheriff’s left and going clockwise, each merchant player takes one turn. 
- On your turn, you may set aside up to **five cards** from your hand (face down), **then draw back up to six cards.**
- When you draw cards, you can take them from the top of either discard pile or the draw pile (in order)
- You must *always* draw the cards you want from the discard piles before drawing any cards from the draw pile.
- After you have drawn cards, place the cards you set aside at the beginning of this phase on one of the discard piles, face up, in any order you choose.
- Drawing cards from the discard pile is a good way to get the cards you want, but it also shows the Sheriff what you take! Of course, this may also be a way to trick him…

#### Load Merchant Bag
- ll merchant players place Goods in their bags at the same time. You can place from one to five Goods in your Merchant Bag. You cannot place zero Goods or more than five Goods in your bag.
- When you are satisfied with the Goods in your bag, snap it closed and place it on the table in front of you. Once you close your bag, you cannot change your mind later!

#### Declaration
- Starting with the player to the Sheriff’s left and going clockwise, each merchant player looks the Sheriff in the eyes and tells him what Goods he is taking to market. 
- When you make your declaration, you must hand your Merchant Bag to the Sheriff.
- **Important: The Sheriff cannot look in the Merchant Bags at this time!**
- You may make any declaration you wish, but you must follow these three conditions:
  - You can only declare Legal Goods.
  - You can only declare one kind of Goods.
  - You must declare only the exact number of cards in your Merchant Bag.

#### Inspection
- When you are the Sheriff, you decide the order in which you inspect the bags. 
- You can inspect any number of Merchant Bags during this phase. 
- You can even decide not to inspect any bags!
- Before you inspect a bag, you may choose to threaten the bag’s owner. 
- That player may offer you a bribe to avoid the inspection. A bribe can be just about anything you can think of, in any combination. Here are some of the things you can offer as part of a bribe:
  - Gold
  - Legal Goods in your Merchant Stand
  - Contraband in your Merchant Stand
  - Goods in your bag (Legal or Contraband)
  - Promises of future favors
  - **You *cannot* offer any of the cards in your hand as part of a bribe!**
- Once the Sheriff has made a choice it cannot be changed. As soon as you unsnap a Merchant Bag or hand it back, it’s too late to change your mind!
- IF THE SHERIFF LETS YOU PASS
  - You must now show the cards in your bag to the other players.
  - All Legal Goods are placed in the matching spaces of your Merchant Stand face up
  - All Contraband is kept secret! You must reveal the number of Contraband cards you have smuggled into Nottingham, but not their type.
- IF THE SHERIFF INSPECTS YOUR BAG
  - **If you were telling the truth**, and your bag has exactly what you declared, the Sheriff must pay you Gold equal to the Penalty on every Legal Good in your bag. Your Legal Goods are then added to your Merchant Stand, as above.
  - **If you were lying, and your bag does not have exactly what you declared**
    - Any Goods that you did declare truthfully are allowed into the market
    - Any Goods that you did not truthfully declare are confiscated! The Sheriff takes all of those Goods and places them on one of the discard piles
    - You must pay a fine to the Sheriff for all confiscated Goods. The fine is equal to the Penalty shown at the bottom of each card.

#### End of Round
- If all players have been Sheriff twice (three times in a three-player game), the game ends immediately!
- pass the Sheriff marker to the player on the left.
- All players draw cards until they again have six cards in hand. 

### HONOR AMONG THIEVES
- Promises of future favors, which take place after the current inspection phase, are not binding!
- A merchant might offer the sheriff a bribe, which includes Goods in his merchant bag. Of course, he might be lying about the contents of his bag. If he is allowed to pass, when he reveals the Goods in his bag, he need only pay the sheriff the Goods he promised which actually exist! If he promised Goods to the sheriff, which are not in his bag, he does not have to pay those.
