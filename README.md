## Ojective
Throughout a game of Twilight Imperium, players will barter, plot, and wage war upon one another to complete objectives. The first
player to accumulate 10 victory points claims the Imperial Throne and wins the game.

## Winning
-  Immediately ends when one player has gained 10 victory points
-  When the speaker would reveal an objective but cannot, the game immediately ends and the player with the most victory points wins the game. If there is a tie, the player among the tied players who is earliest in initiative order wins the game.
- **Important: A player cannot score public objectives if he does not control all of the planets in his home system.**
- **Important: A player cannot have more than three total scored and un-scored secret objectives. If he draws a secret objective and has more than three, he must choose one of his un-scored secret objectives and return it to the deck. Then, he shuffles the secret objective deck.**

## PHASES

### STRATEGY PHASE
  - speaker places one trade good on each strategy card that was not chosen
### ACTION PHASE
  - on your turn you take 1 action
  - around and around in initiative order
  - once you pass you are done for the phase
    - you can not pass until you have done your **tactical action**
  - phase ends when each player has passed
  - there are 3 types of actions
### STATUS PHASE
1. SCORE OBJECTIVES
  - **main way to win!!!**
  - objective timing page 12
  - score up to one public and one secret objective
  - advance token on the victory point track a number of spaces equal to the value of the objective card.
  - place a control token on the objective to show that it has been complete
  - Some objectives require a player to win a combat; a player has won a space combat if he is the only player with ships remaining in the active system when the combat has ended.
  - **Important: A player cannot score public objectives if he does not control all of the planets in his home system.**
  - **Important: A player cannot have more than three total scored and un-scored secret objectives. If he draws a secret objective and has more than three, he must choose one of his un-scored secret objectives and return it to the deck. Then, he shuffles the secret objective deck.**
2. REVEAL PUBLIC OBJECTIVE
  - flips the next unrevealed public objective
3. DRAW ACTION CARDS
  - 1 card in normal order
4. REMOVE COMMAND TOKENS
  -  removes all command tokens
5. GAIN AND REDISTRIBUTE COMMAND TOKENS
  - gain 2 command tokens
  - redistribute
6. READY CARDS:
7. REPAIR UNITS
8. RETURN STRATEGY CARDS

### AGENDA PHASE
- if the token in the middle is gone move on to this phase
- The agenda phase involves heavy negotiation and political maneuvering
- Players may freely move units into the Mecatol Rex system, but cannot land ground forces on the planet while the custodians token is present.
- To remove this token, the active player must spend six influence immediately before landing ground forces on the planet.
- once removed gain one victory point
- How it works
  - FIRST AGENDA
    - i. REVEAL AGENDA
    - ii. VOTE
    - iii. RESOLVE OUTCOME
  - 2. SECOND AGENDA
    - i. REVEAL AGENDA
    - ii. VOTE
    - iii. RESOLVE OUTCOME
  - 4. READY PLANETS
  - When it is a player’s turn to cast votes, he may exhaust any number of his planets. Each planet contributes a number of votes equal to its influence value.
  - “I’m casting three votes to elect the Hacan player” or “I’m casting three votes against this agenda.”
  - may, however, choose to abstain from the vote entirely
  - During each vote, players may freely negotiate transactions with other players, even if they are not neighbors with those players.
  - Each player may negotiate up to one transaction with each other player while resolving the vote for each agenda.
  - **If multiple outcomes receive the same number of votes after all players have voted, the speaker decides which of the tied outcomes is resolved.**
  - Each player readies all of his planet cards. Then, the agenda phase ends and players begin a new game round, starting with the strategy phase.

## Actions
  - tactical actions
    - **see below**
  - strategic actions
    -  The active player cannot resolve the secondary ability of his own strategy card
  - component actions
    - look for *Action* on pretty much anything

    - do not spend
    - maximum number of ships in a system
      -  **excluding fighters**
    - return ships to reinforcements

## TACTICAL ACTION
1. ACTIVATION
  -  A player cannot activate a system that already contains one of his command tokens, but he may activate a system that contains other players' command tokens.
2. MOVEMENT
  - A ship must end its movement in the active system
  - A ship cannot pass through a system that contains another player’s ships, **excluding fighters**.
  - A player cannot move units out of a system that contains one of his command tokens.
  - SPACE CANNON OFFENSE
    - After the active player’s ships move into the active system, each player’s units in the active system may use their “Space Cannon” abilities against the active player’s ships
  - When such a ship moves, it may transport a number of **fighters** and ground forces
  - ships may also pick up and transport ground forces and fighters from systems that they pass through that **do not contain any of their command tokens**
  - The number of fighters and ground forces that a player has in the space area of a system cannot exceed the combined capacity of that player’s ships in that system. **Excess units are destroyed.**
  - special systems page 14
3. SPACE COMBAT
  - **If multiple players have ships in the active system, they must resolve a space combat in that system**
  - combat continues till only one sides ships are left
  - ANNOUNCE RETREAT:
    - If a player wishes to retreat with any of his ground forces that are on planets in the active system, he must move them from planets to the space area during this step.
    - If a unit’s combat value contains two or more burst icons, the player rolls this number of dice instead, potentially producing one hit with each die rolled.
    -  The chosen system cannot contain ships that belong to another player and must contain either a planet he controls or at least one of his units; otherwise, the player cannot retreat.
    -  place one token from his reinforcements in that system when he retreats
4. INVASION
  - BOMBARDMENT
    - if units have the ability
  - COMMIT GROUND FORCES
  - SPACE CANNON DEFENSE
  - GROUND COMBAT
  - ESTABLISH CONTROL
    - at least one of his ground force
    - gains its corresponding planet card and places it in his play area exhausted
    -  if the planet contains structures that belong to another player, those structures are destroyed.
5. PRODUCTION PAGE 16!!!
  - The active player can produce units using his space docks **in the active system**.
  - check production space dock limits
  - cannot produce more units than the combined production values of his units in the active system.
  - **If a unit’s cost is accompanied by two icons, such as the cost values of fighters and infantry, the player receives two units for the indicated cost. When producing these units, each individual unit counts against the production limit.**
  - choose to produce any of the units on faction sheet by spending resources equal to the chosen unit’s cost.
  - ships go to space
  - ground units stay on planet
  - When producing multiple units at a time, the cost values of those units are added together to determine the total cost.

## TRANSACTIONS AND DEALS
- The active player may negotiate only once with each of his neighbors per turn
- **binding deals**
- Not all deals are binding, if the deal cannot be resolved immediately, this deal is a non-binding deal

## TECHNOLOGY
- Each player has an identical deck of technology cards
- Each player begins the game with a number of starting technologies as indicated on the back of his faction sheet.
- The white arrows next to an attribute’s value on the faction sheet indicate that the attribute will improve when its unit is upgraded.
- Prerequisites are printed as a column on the lower-left side of each technology card and contain one or more symbols that correspond to the four basic technology colors.
- Some planets provide the player with a technology specialty
  - exhaust that planet when researching technology to ignore a prerequisite that matches that technology specialty.
  - **may exhaust planets for their technology specialty or for their resources, but not for both**
